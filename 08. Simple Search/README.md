# Simple Search

## Description
This program performs a simple search inside a fixed array of strings.  
The array contains **six** names:  
"Jake", "Zac", "Ian", "Ron", "Sam", "Dave".  
The user is asked to type a name, and the program searches for that name inside the array.   
If the name is found, the program prints the position in two ways:
- **1-based position** (human-friendly counting)
- **0-based index** (programmer counting)

## How to run
- 1 Open the terminal in VS Code.
- 2 Compile the program:  
g++ SimpleSearch.cpp -o SimpleSearch

- 3 Execute
- On Windows:  
.\ SimpleSearch.exe
- On MacOS / Linux:  
./SimpleSearch

## What I learned
- How to create and use a `fixed array` in C++.
- How to compare `strings` using the equality operator.
- How to use a for loop to search through an array.
- The difference between `array index (0-based)` and `human position (1-based)`.
- How to stop a loop early using `break` when a match is found.
- How to allow the user to input a search term.

## Academic Integrity Note
I use ChatGPT as a study support tool, mainly to review content, clarify doubts, and correct typing errors.  
After learning and understanding the concepts, **I independently** developed and wrote the **final version** of the code.
