# Simple Search

## Description
This program performs a simple search inside a fixed array of strings.  
The array contains **six** names:  
"Jake", "Zac", "Ian", "Ron", "Sam", "Dave".  
The program loops through the array and checks each position until it finds the name `Sam`.  
If name is found, it prints the position in two ways:
- **1based position** (human-friendly counting)
- **0-based index** (programmer counting)

## How to run
- 1 Open the terminal in VS Code.
- 2 Compile the program:  
g++SimpleSearch.cpp -o SimpleSearch

- 3 Execute
- On Windows:  
.\ SimpleSearch.exe
- On MacOS / Linux:  
./SimpleShearch

## What I learned
- How to create and use a `fixed array` in C++.
- How to compare `strings` using the equality operator.
- The difference btween `array index (0-based)` and `human position(1-based)`.
- How to stop a loop early using `break` when a match is found.

## Academic Integrity Note
I use ChatGPT to study and understand the task requirements.
After learning the concepts, I adapted and wrote the **final version** of the code myself.
