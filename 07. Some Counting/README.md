# Some Counting

## Description
This program demonstrates different types of counting using for loops in C++.  
The goal is to practice counting upward and downward using custom increments and decrements.  
The program performs **five different counting** tasks, printing all results to the terminal:
- 1- Counts up from **0 to 50** in increments of 1.
- 2- Counts down from **50 to 0** in decrements of 1.
- 3- Counts up from **30 to 50** in increments of 1.
- 4- Counts down from **50 to 10** in decrements of 2.
- 5- Counts up from **100 to 200** in increments of 5.


## How to run
- 1 Open the terminal in VS Code.
- 2 Compile the program:  
g++ SomeCounting.cpp -o SomeCounting

- 3 Execute
- On Windows:  
.\ SomeCounting.exe
- On MacOS / Linux:  
./SomeCounting

## What I learned
- How to use `for` loops in different situations.
- How to `count` `up` and `down` using custom step values.
- How `loop` conditions control when a loop `starts` and `ends`.
- How to adjust counting speed using increments `i++` and decrements `i--, i-=2, i+=5`.
- Reinforced my understanding of control `flow` in C++.

## Academic Integrity Note
I use ChatGPT as a study support tool, mainly to review content, clarify doubts, and correct typing errors.  
After learning and understanding the concepts, **I independently** developed and wrote the **final version** of the code.
