# Brute Force Attack

## Description
This program simulates a bruce force attack by trying every 4 letter lowercase combination (from `aaaa` to `zzzz`) until it finds the correct password.  
It prints each attempt and shows the total number of attempts when the password is found.  
The program demonstrates nested `for` loops, string building, and string comparison.  
I learned how loops can generate combinations and how to compare and build strings in C++.   

## How to run
- 1 Open the terminal in VS Code.
- 2 Compile the program:  
g++BruteForceAttack.cpp -o BruteForceAttack
- 3 Execute

.\BruteForceAttack.exe

## What I learned
- Use `string` variables to store text.
- Build strings dynamically using `+=` to add characters.
- Use nested `for` loops to generate combinations.
- Compare strings with `==`.
- Print program output using `cout` and add line breaks using `\n`.
