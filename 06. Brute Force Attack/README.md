# Brute Force Attack

## Description
This program simulates a simple password protection system.  
The correct password is 12345, and the user has 5 attempts to enter it.  
The program uses a while loop to control the number of attempts.  
If the user enters the correct password, access is granted and the program displays a welcome message.  
If the user enters the wrong password 5 times, the program displays an alert message saying that the authorities have been notified.  
**This exercise practices:**  
- Loop control.
- Conditional statements.
- Basic security logic simulation.
- Using input handling.


## How to run
- 1 Open the terminal in VS Code.
- 2 Compile the program:  
g++ BruteForceAttack.cpp -o BruteForceAttack

- 3 Execute
- On Windows:
.\BruteForceAttack.exe
- On MacOS / Linux:
./BruteForceAttack

## What I learned
- How to use a while loop to repeat an action until a condition becomes false.
- How to control the number of attempts using a counter variable.
- How to compare user input with a stored value using an if statement.
- How to stop the loop early when the user enters the correct password.
- How to display different outputs for success and failure cases.

## Academic Integrity Note
I use ChatGPT as a study support tool, mainly to review content, clarify doubts, and correct typing errors.  
After learning and understanding the concepts, **I independently** developed and wrote the **final version** of the code.
