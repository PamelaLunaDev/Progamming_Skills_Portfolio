# Simple Search

## Description
This program reads list of intengers from the user and performs a simple linear search to find a target number.  
It returns the position (1-based) of the first occurrence or informs that the number was no found.  

## How to run
- 1 Open the terminal in VS Code.
- 2 Compile the program:  
g++SimpleSearch.cpp -o SimpleSearch
- 3 Execute

.\ SimpleSearch.exe

## What I learned
- How to read and store multiple values using `std::vector`.
- How to implement a linear search (checking elements one by one).
- How to use a `for` loop and `if` to compare values.
- Difference betwen 0-based index (programming) and 1-based position (human-friendly).
