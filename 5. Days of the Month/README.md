# Days Of The Month

## Description
This program asks the user to enter a month number (1 to 12) and displays how many days that month has.
It uses the **`switch` satatment** to check the value entered by the user and prints `28`, `30` or `31` depending on the month.
If user enters an invalid number (outside 1 to 12), the program displays the message **"Invalid month"**. 

## How to run
- 1 Open the terminal in VS Code.
- 2 Compile the program:  
g++DaysOfTheMonth.cpp -o DaysOfTheMonth
- 3 Execute

.\ DaysOfTheMonth.exe

## What I learned
- Use **`switch`** statement to handle multiple options.
- Group several **`case`** statements that share the same output.
- Use **`break`** to stop the program from falling into the next case.
- Use **`default`** to handle invalid inputs.
- Reinforced understanding of **conditional logic** and **program structure** in C++.
