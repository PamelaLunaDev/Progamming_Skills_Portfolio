# Hello

## Description
This program demonstrates how to create and call a simple function in C++.  
The function **prints the word "Hello"** to the console when executed.
The goal of this exercise is to practice:
- Declaring a function.
- Calling a function from main.
- Using `cout` to display output.

## How to run
- 1 Open the terminal in VS Code.
- 2 Compile the program:  
g++Hello.cpp -o Hello

- 3 Execute
- On Windows:  
.\ Hello.exe
- On MacOS / Linux:  
./Hello

## What I learned
- How to create a basic function in C++ using `void`.
- How to call a function from the main function.
- How to print text to the console using `cout`.
- Basic program structure in C++.

## Academic Integrity Note
I use ChatGPT to study and understand the task requirements.
After learning the concepts, I adapted and wrote the **final version** of the code myself.
