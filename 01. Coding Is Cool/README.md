# Coding Is Cool

## Description
This is the first exercise from my Programming Skills Portfolio (Code Lab 1).  
The program prints the message **"Coding is cool"** to the terminal.   
The goal is to display a simple message on the screen using `cout`.

## How to run
- 1 Open the terminal in VS Code.
- 2 Compile the program:  
g++ CodingIsCool.cpp -o CodingIsCool

- 3 Execute
- On Windows:  
.\ CodingIsCool.exe

- On MacOS / Linux:  
./CodingIsCool

## What I learned
- Use `#include <iostream>`.
- Use `cout` to display text on the screen.
- Understand basic structure of a C++ program.

## Academic Integrity Note
I use ChatGPT as a study support tool, mainly to review content, clarify doubts, and correct typing errors.  
After learning and understanding the concepts, **I independently** developed and wrote the **final version** of the code.
