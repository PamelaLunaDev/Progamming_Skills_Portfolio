# Simple Sums

## Description
This program declares two integer variables with fixed values **(8 and 10)**, adss them together, and prints the result to the terminal.  
The goal of the exercise is to practice variable declaration, initialization, and basic arithmetic in C++.

## How to run
- 1 Open the terminal in VS Code.
- 2 Compile the program:  
g++SimpleSums.cpp -o SimpleSums

- 3 Execute
- On Windows:  
.\ SimpleSums.exe

- On MacOS / Linux:  
./SimpleSums

## What I learned
- How to declare variables using the `int` data type. 
- How to initialize variables with fixed values.
- How to store the result of an arithmetic operation in a **new** variable.
- Basic structure of a simple C++ program.

## Academic Integrity Note
I use ChatGPT to study and understand the task requirements.
After learning the concepts, I adapted and wrote the **final version** of the code myself.
