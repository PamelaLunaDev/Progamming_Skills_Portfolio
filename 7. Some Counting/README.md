# Some Counting

## Description
This program asks the user for a intenger N and analyzes the numbers from 1 to N.  
It calculates and prints:
- the sum of the numbers,
- the average,
- the count of even numbers,
- the count of odd numbers.

## How to run
- 1 Open the terminal in VS Code.
- 2 Compile the program:  
g++SomeCounting.cpp -o SomeCounting
- 3 Execute

## What I learned

- Use `%` to check even/odd numbers.
- Convert to `double` to cauculate average with decimals.
