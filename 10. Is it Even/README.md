## What I learned
- How to create and use `functions` to organize code.
- How to pass `values` from the main function to another function.
- Hoe to use the `modulus operator (%)` to detect even mumbers.
- How to return `strings` from a `function`.
- Improved understanding of control `flow`, `input handling`, and `function` structure in C++.

## Academic Integrity Note
I use ChatGPT to study and understand the task requirements.
After learning the concepts, I adapted and wrote the **final version** of the code myself.
