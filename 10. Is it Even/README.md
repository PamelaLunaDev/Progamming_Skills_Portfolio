# It Is Even

## Description
This program asks the user for an integer number and checks wheter it is even or odd.  
It demonstrate how to use conditional statements (`if` / `else`) and the modulus operator `%` in C++.

## How to run
- 1 Open the terminal in VS Code.
- 2 Compile the program:  
g++ItIsEven.cpp -o ItIsEven
- 3 Execute

.\ ItIsEven.exe

## What I learned
- Use `if` / `else` to make decisions in code.
- Use the modulus operator `%` to check for even or odd numbers.
- Pratice reading and printing integer values.
- Understand how condition results (`true` or `false`) control program flow.
